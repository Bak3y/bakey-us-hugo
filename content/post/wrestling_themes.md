At this point portions of Hugo feel like magic. Which is good in some cases I suppose.  One thing I'd like to understand a bit better is why I could never get the [Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme working, or why the main page using the current [black-and-light](https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/hugo-black-and-light-theme) shows my `About` page like it's a post.
